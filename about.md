Currently at [Twitter](https://twitter.com) hacking on Live.

Previously I was at [Collabora](http://www.collabora.co.uk/), where I
worked with open source software including
[Wayland](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/),
[EGL](http://www.mesa3d.org/egl.html),
[Telepathy](http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/),
[Maemo](http://www.maemo.org/), [Tizen](http://www.tizen.org/),
[D-Bus](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/), [GLib](http://www.gtk.org/),
[GStreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/), and
[Android](http://www.android.org/).

Other open source interests have included
[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org).
I successfully completed the
[Debexpo](https://wiki.debian.org/Debexpo) project for Debian in the
[Google Summer of
Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) 2008. For years
I was a contributor to the
[SynCE](http://sourceforge.net/projects/synce/) and
[Bongo](http://gna.org/projects/bongo) projects where I assumed
several roles, including project leader, release manager, package
maintainer, and software maintainer.
