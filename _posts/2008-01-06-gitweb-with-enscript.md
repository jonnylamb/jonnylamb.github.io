I got a little bored of looking at gitweb with no syntax highlighting,
so I shoved in support for Enscript:

{% include figure.html src="https://jonnylamb.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/gitweb-enscript-1-thumb.png" %}

Also, it's easier to select source straight from the browser without
the line numbers prefixing every line -- something one does every day,
of course:

{% include figure.html src="https://jonnylamb.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/gitweb-enscript-2-thumb.png" %}

Of course, there are a few bugs and limitations in this. I just wanted
to blog with some pretty pictures, I suppose. Now I can see why I've
never touched perl before though.
