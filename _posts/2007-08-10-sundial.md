Recently I started adding [CalDAV](http://www.caldav.org) support into
[Bongo](http://bongo-project.org). This is actually progressing very
well. I'm working on the sundial branch in Subversion. If you want to
try it out, then you can checkout using:

```
svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/bongo/branches/sundial/
```

And then [install how one normally would from
source](http://bongo-project.org/Installation/Source). To try out the
CalDAV support, you must be running standalone -- Apache will simply
not work at the moment. Point your client at:

```
http://server:port/dav/username/calendar/
```

You _should_ be asked for username and password, but the auth system is a little broken at the moment. It is next on my list of things to do with Sundial, and hopefully I'll commit a fix for that tonight, but I might not have time.

Remember that this is three or four days old and not only will it have
bugs, but if you glance at the code, there are many TODOs floating
around, so this is _very_ alpha quality software. With respect to
CalDAV client support, I've done most of the testing on [Mozilla
Sunbird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/) and in my
opinion that has the best CalDAV support, but
[Evolution](http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/) _should_ work
(it did last night)! Come find me on [IRC](irc://irc.oftc.net/bongo)
if you have any questions.
