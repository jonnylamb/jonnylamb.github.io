debexpo (Debian package exposition) is a web application that allows
one to run a user-friendly public Debian package repository with
social interaction that one may be used to from social networking
sites. debexpo will be the basis for the
[mentors.debian.net](http://mentors.debian.net/) site but will be
useful for others as well. debexpo is the project I am [working
on](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/debian/appinfo.html?csaid=D4B754E7C110F53D)
for this year's [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) for
Debian under the watch of [Christoph
Haas](http://blog.workaround.org/).

debexpo is more than just a web application though. It was based on
[suggestions by you](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMentorsNet), and
therefore it has some nifty features:

* Uploading is done through HTTP PUT directly in debexpo, and handled
  immediately. This means that packages can be available within
  seconds of you uploading the package instead of having to wait for a
  cron job running an importer.

* debexpo supports plugins for several stages of package life-cycle.
  The main use of these are for QA purposes on the package, such as
  automatically running Lintian, checking the watch file, or checking
  bugs closed actually belong to the package in question, but there is
  scope for much more. Plugins are
  [easy](http://debexpo.workaround.org/trac/browser/debexpo/plugins/lintian.py)
  so you can customize a repository to check for whatever you want.
  Other cool plugins allow features such as [pulling an `orig.tar.gz`
  from
  Debian](http://debexpo.workaround.org/trac/browser/debexpo/plugins/getorigtarball.py)
  if it is absent from the upload and not in the repository already.
  Plugins provide you the option to customize your repository for any
  purpose.

* Users will be able to have their own personal repository (much like
  Launchpad's PPAs) to host binary packages. This is simply achieved
  by creating a new user, uploading, and adding the appropriate entry
  to your `sources.list`.

* Sponsors will be able to tell debexpo what kind of packages he or
  she likes to see, and a filtered package list will be shown. These
  kind of filters will include whether it's a python package, or C
  library, whether it uses CDBS or straight debhelper, or even whether
  the maintainer is in the New Maintainer process (this is clearly a
  mentors-specific feature).

* Packages will be able to be commented on by other users, in the same
  way as [Ubuntu's REVU](http://revu.tauware.de/) tool. This keeps
  package discussion in one place, and Debian Developers can claim to
  have uploaded the package. This is useful to stop the scenario of a
  Debian Developer reviewing a package that has requested a sponsor,
  and then finding the package has been uploaded already after the
  initial uploader left no mention of this.

* And [more to come](http://debexpo.workaround.org/trac/roadmap).

Development can be tracked through its Trac instance:
[http://debexpo.workaround.org/](http://debexpo.workaround.org), where
I invite you to submit tickets or even submit patches! Its Git
repository is public:
[http://debexpo.workaround.org/debexpo.git](http://debexpo.workaround.org/debexpo.git).
Last but not least, the there is also [a low-traffic mailing
list](http://workaround.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/debexpo-devel).

I invite you to try it out, and report bugs. Posting to [the
list](http://workaround.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/debexpo-devel) is
a great way to get in contact.

There is little visible eye-candy in your browser to show for the work
so far as nearly all the work so far has gone into the backend. A
sneak peek at what it looks like at the moment is available though:

As you can see, the theme is somewhat familiar. Hopefully, as the SoC
program nears an end, [this will be
fixed](http://debexpo.workaround.org/trac/ticket/42).

This is my first post to [Planet Debian](http://planet.debian.org/).
