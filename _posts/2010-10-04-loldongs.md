My network blocks SIP on 3G, so when I start using its 3G service
after leaving a wireless network my N900 constantly complains about
not being able to connect. Although this is my specific annoyance,
there are many similar requests, such as _I only want my work XMPP
account enabled when I'm at work_.

I wrote a simple application to achieve this. A list of wireless
networks is configured per instant messaging account.
[libconic](http://maemo.org/api_refs/5.0/5.0-final/libconic/) is used
to listen for connect & disconnect events. When said events occur,
accounts are enabled or disabled as configured.

I just uploaded it to extras-devel. It's called [Automatic
Connections](http://maemo.org/packages/view/loldongs/).
